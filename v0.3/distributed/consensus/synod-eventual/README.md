# SYNOD-EVENTUAL

##### This repository contains theory and proofs about the Synod consensus algorithm


##### Instructions:

* The `progress-proof.ath` file contains the proof of eventual progress for the Synod consensus protocol using the failure-aware actor model under soem specific asynchronous conditions

* The `conditions-proof.ath` file contains the proof of our conditions under predicate fairness for FAM

* The proofs make use of the SPASS Automatic Theorem Prover for proving the proof obligation at each step

* Refer to the ATHENA [Download Instructions](https://proofcentral.org/athena/1.4/) to properly set up SPASS in your operating system

* Refer to [this PDF](https://proofcentral.org/book/Appendix_D.pdf) to learn more about using ATPs with ATHENA

* Once ATHENA and SPASS have been installed and set up, load `progress-proof.ath` to verify the proofs using ATHENA

* The `OUTPUT_progress-proof` file contains preverified output of `progress-proof.ath` in ATHENA

* The `OUTPUT_conditions-proof` file contains preverified output of `conditions-proof.ath` in ATHENA

###### Note: This library is under development and many modules may be currently just stubs
